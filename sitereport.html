                            Basic Web Development Report:
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            Learning the basics of anything is pretty hard.
                            After getting basic knowledge we can move ahead
                            ourselves and fast. Learning web development is
                            always exciting for me. Though I like web
                            development still got trouble learning the basics of
                            it. There are many rules of writing code we have to
                            get used to maintaining it for learning quality
                            coding. We know HTML and CSS are the most basic
                            things of web development. Learning HTML was pretty
                            challenging for me. When I saw the tag list in
                            w3school I got panicked about how to memorise all
                            these tags but after that day I read a blog about
                            Html which helped me be easy to html. CSS was much
                            more enjoyable. I enjoyed very much learning basic
                            css. Though I did some major mistakes such as
                            selecting id with a dot. sometimes I got stuck with
                            a very simple mistake and got frustrated then I did
                            some google search and find out that mistake. That
                            moment was so satisfying. I was very weak in
                            designing anything not just website but anything. So
                            I was very afraid of web designing. Then I observe
                            some of websites, Color schemes, basic rules of
                            typography and I find myself imporved in designing.
                            Now I am confident to design any kind of website. At
                            the very first of coding I was very weak of
                            debugging. Then I got introduced to chrome dev tool.
                            Now I can find bugs easily and solve them in a very
                            short time. Chrome dev tool helped me a lot for
                            developig responsive websites.

                        <p>
                            In this module I learned basic web development with
                            html and css. Html is the structure of a website.
                            Css used to make html and overall webpage more
                            attractive and easy to user to interect with. There
                            a lot of things in html such as tag, arttibute,
                            semantic element, linking was new to me. In case of
                            css it's pretty straight forward some rules of
                            selecting html elements and apply some css property
                            to make them more attractive.

                        <p>
                            This assignment helped me to learn w3 validate code.
                            I confirmed validation of my code for index.html and
                            style.css from w3 validator. Here are screenshots of
                            w3 validation
